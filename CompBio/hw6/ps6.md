## Q1

Please find the definition of BLAST E-value from NCBI website. Could E-value be greater than 1? Why?

## Q2

Choosing proper (k, T) pair is one the keys for the success of BLAST. Please describe the effect of increasing/decreasing k, increasing/decreasing T.

## Q3

How does 2-hit BLAST reach better speed and sensitivity?

## Q4

Why PSI-BLAST is better than BLAST in searching distant homologs?

## Q5

Two matrices are used to describe the double random process for a hidden Markov model. What are the names of the two matrices? What are the meanings of the two matrices?

## Q6

Describe the three key problems of HMM. What are the possible applications of them (list at least one example for each problem). What algorithms and tools you can use to solve each problem?

## Q7

Whatâ€™s the key idea of PatternHunter? Is it more sensitive than BLAST, given that they have the seeds with the same weight?
