# AlphaFold3 Hands On

1. **Use AF3 to select/determine substrate.**

PurA, PurZ and PurZ0 utilize ATP or GTP as one of their substrates. Please use AlphaFold3to "cofold" ATP or GTP with a PurA, a PurZ and a PurZ0, and use proper evaluation method to tell which NTP is the right substrate for each enzyme.

Please upload the UniProt accessions for the PurA, PurZ, PurZ0 you picked and the 3 correct complex structures as your answer.

2. **Use AF3 to discover novel viral proteins that can inhibit host immunity.\*\***

Read the paper "[Structure-guided discovery of viral proteins that inhibit host immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424014788)" and then use AlphaFold3 to predict the following 7 complex structures.

    a. ThsB + Tad3/Tad4/Tad5/Tad6/Tad7 (Fig.1 & Fig.2)
    b. ThsA + Tad8, CD-NTase + Abc3 (Fig.2)

Please upload the 7 complex structures as your answer.

3. **Use AF3 to find ligand binding pockets and poses.**

Read the paper "[Structured Odorant Response Patterns across a Complete Olfactory Receptor Neuron Population](<https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31150-4#fig3>)" and then use AlphaFold3 to predict the complex structure of the top 5 sensitive ligand-receptor pairs in Fig 3B.

Please upload the 5 complex structures as your answer.
